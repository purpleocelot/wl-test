## WL Tech Test

## David Lawton

Although overkill for a simple console app, I used Nest.js for this test because the CLI tool quickly creates a Node app with a well structure Angular-like architecture, provides dependency injection, and also includes a testing framework.

## Installing the app dependencies

Open a terminal in the project root and type:

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Running the app

```bash
$ npm run start
```

## Running the Tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
